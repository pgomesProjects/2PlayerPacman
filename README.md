# 2 Player Pacman

"Play the classic game of Pacman, but instead of a bunch of AI chasing you around, you have a friend on your tail trying to keep you from finishing your game! The winner of this game is for you two to decide!"

The gameplay is meant to mimic that of the original Pacman game. In Pacman, the main player (Pacman) must collect all of the pellets in the level and stay away from the enemies (ghosts). In this rendition of Pacman, the two players decide which role to play: Pacman or the Ghost. The players must strategically out-maneuver the other in order to take all 3 lives of Pacman or to collect all of the pellets on the game board.

Besides the 2 player aspect of the game, there will be many of the original game’s mechanics. These include a warp function on both sides of the map, a pickup pellet system, continuous movement that’s redirected by joysticks, and a basic win / lose system depending on whether the player gets caught or when the player gets all of the pellets in the game. One unique mechanic in the game is the character selection system. The players will get to decide who acts as Pacman or the ghost.
